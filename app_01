It is due to the critical health condition of my mother that I would like to extend my WFH privilege.

For the last seven years, I have been providing her with constant care and support, including frequent medical appointments. As a result of her condition, she requires ongoing attention and presence.

As there is no one at home to regulate the situation, it is solely my responsibility to handle it.

It would be very helpful if you could allow me to work from home for around three months (October-December).

I hope the situation can be tailored within this timeframe so that I can begin operational activities in January.

I would be grateful if you would grant my request so that I can follow the process by raising a request through the Portal.

I will need to visit my hometown to submit medical documents if the request is approved in the system.
