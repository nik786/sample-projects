I want to keep few points on the table.
First of all, I want to inform all of you that we have crossed 80% for both v3 and v4 in this quarter's patching cycle for APItech.
We have reached to the target before two weeks only.
But waited to monitor the spike as it fluctutates.
becoz v4 taget crssed in the month of december , but it came down in the month of january due to scaling down activity from api team end.
It has been delayed by few days. As There have multiple stake holders and hoping points involved to accelearte the process.
There has been few struggling points to identify the scope and moved it forward.
Struggling points enrich us with new experiences and learning.
Personally I think Alwyas we need to cherish the positive result on the board at the end of game. 
So We have crossed the bar.

2nd, point

I would like to thanks poorva for her remarakable contribution during q2 cycle.
The way she performed almost all prod patching crs along with bau tasks is really admirable.
Gradually she is turning out to be one of the best performer in this project.
If only stats and count is the yardstick of evaluation then also her performace attributes supports it.
I know her learning zeal curving towrads other areas of the project but i hope she will continue to keep fruitful contribution during the q3 patching cycle as well.
Obvislouly there is a strategy in the place to ease the workload for her during q3 cycle. 
Thanks once again. Lets maintain the same zeal in future as well.
