We have been developing the chatbot engine to serve the FAQs for SM, with me leading this POC. 
It will help to ease the workload in the support model. I've trained this chatbot engine by help of python based machine 
learning module scikit-learn and used json file as a data source.
Next, it needs to be able to work with a large dataset, followed by reacting to queries in Confluence. 
As I'm currently occupied with exit formalities, I'm passing this responsibility to my teammate Ankit. 
I believe that he will foster it according to business needs and drive it to the next layer. 
My support window will be available for Ankit and the team.
Ankit and team will coordinate closely with Kulbhusan to ensure seamless navigation. 
Barclays has significant prospects for generative AI, where the LLM module will play a pivotal role in the support model.
Additionally, the scope of AI and ML extends not only within Barclays periscope but also globally. 
The upcoming years are expected to be dominated by AI and ML. 
I am sharing the presentation that I created based on all my research on this topic. 
My best wishes go with team on this journey.
